# SVM Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a tutorial and practical implementation of **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The **Jupyter Notebook** provided explains the theory behind SVM, demonstrates how the algorithm works, and showcases practical examples of its application on real datasets.

Support Vector Machines are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and are often used in applications like image classification, text categorization, and bioinformatics.

## Contents
1. `SVM Machine Learning.ipynb` – The Jupyter Notebook containing the SVM tutorial and example code.
2. `README.md` – This file, providing an overview of the repository and usage instructions.

## Navigation
The following topics are covered in the Jupyter Notebook:
- **Introduction to SVM**: Explanation of the theory behind Support Vector Machines.
- **Mathematical Foundations**: A deep dive into the mathematics and concepts, such as margin, support vectors, and kernel tricks.
- **SVM for Classification**: Example implementations of SVM for binary and multiclass classification tasks.
- **Visualization**: Visualization of hyperplanes and decision boundaries created by SVM.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Techniques for optimizing SVM using parameters like C and gamma.
